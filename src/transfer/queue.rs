/// Manages a stream of transfers on an endpoint.
///
/// A `Queue` optimizes a common pattern when streaming data to or from a USB
/// endpoint: To maximize throughput and minimize latency, the host controller
/// needs to attempt a transfer in every possible frame. That requires always
/// having a transfer request pending with the kernel by submitting multiple
/// transfer requests and re-submitting them as they complete.
///
/// Use the methods on [`Interface`][`crate::Interface`] to obtain a `Queue`.
///
/// When the `Queue` is dropped, all pending transfers are cancelled.
///
/// ### Why use a `Queue` instead of submitting multiple transfers individually with the methods on [`Interface`][`crate::Interface`]?
///
///  * Individual transfers give you individual `Future`s, which you then have
///    to keep track of and poll using something like `FuturesUnordered`.
///  * A `Queue` provides better cancellation semantics than `Future`'s
///    cancel-on-drop.
///     * After dropping a [`TransferFuture`][super::TransferFuture], you lose
///       the ability to get the status of the cancelled transfer and see if it
///       may have been partially or fully completed.
///     * When cancelling multiple transfers, it's important to do so in reverse
///       order so that subsequent pending transfers can't end up executing.
///       When managing a collection of `TransferFuture`s it's tricky to
///       guarantee drop order, while `Queue` always cancels its contained
///       transfers in reverse order.
///     * The `TransferFuture` methods on `Interface` are not [cancel-safe],
///       meaning they cannot be used in `select!{}` or similar patterns,
///       because dropping the Future has side effects and can lose data. The
///       Future returned from [`Queue::next_complete`] is cancel-safe because
///       it merely waits for completion, while the `Queue` owns the pending
///       transfers.
///  * A queue caches the internal transfer data structures of the last
///    completed transfer, meaning that if you re-use the data buffer there is
///    no memory allocation involved in continued streaming.
///
/// [cancel-safe]: https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/macro.select.html#cancellation-safety
